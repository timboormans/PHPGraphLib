PHPGraphLib Graphing Library

The first version PHPGraphLib was written in 2007 by Elliott Brueggeman to
deliver PHP generated graphs quickly and easily. It has grown in both features
and maturity since its inception, but remains PHP 4.04+ compatible. Originally
available only for paid commercial use, PHPGraphLib was open-sourced in 2013
under the MIT License. Please visit http://www.ebrueggeman.com/phpgraphlib 
for more information.

In 2016 the library has had an overhaul by https://github.com/jeroenst/phpgraphlib

In 2026 the library is bugfixed by Tim Boormans and partly rewritten to be able
to run under PHP 8 in more restricted environments. Also changed the way in which
the output is handled, giving more control to the developer. Re-released under the
MIT License under which the library originally also was released.

The added 'docs' folder is scraped from internet history and heavily redacted afterwards.
