# PHPGraphLib Graphing Library

### ![PHPGraphLib logo](docs/res/php_graph_icon.gif) PHPGraphLib is a lightweight PHP server-side graphing library that creates graphs and charts

PHPGraphLib has powerful customization features allowing you to generate the perfect bar, line, stacked bar, or pie graph for any web application. Used with dynamic data, PHPGraphLib allows easy visual interpretation of sophisticated data sets. Simply feed PHPGraphLib an array of data points and it will generate a .png chart of your data to be displayed on a web page or saved to a file.

PHPGraphLib adjusts the scale and axis of the graph to fit any data, including large numbers, decimal numbers, and negative numbers. PHPGraphlib currently supports up to 5 datasets on one graph or chart.
